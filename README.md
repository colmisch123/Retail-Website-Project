# About

This repo serves as an archive of all iterations of my website project. The website itself acts as a fake digital retail website where users can place online orders for products. With each new version of the project, the scope, capabilities, and look of the website all improve. 

## Versions

Version 1 of the project involves a website backend running in Python to navigate between the pages, and the pages themselves are constructed with simple HTML. 

Version 2 involved implementing CSS and dynamic HTML through multi-line python strings, as well as some basic images.

Version 3 allows users to place new orders, as well as update and cancel them. It also introduces the usage of Javascript to make pages more dynamic, and POST requests to update orders in the backend.

Version 4: Current work in progress and unpublished.

# Running
To run versions 1-4, simply run the terminal command ```python server.py``` while your terminal is in the respective version directory.

Ex: If you want to run version 3, navigate to the version 3 subdirectory in your terminal then run ```python server.py```. Then, navigate to [http:](http://localhost:4131/) in your preffered web browser to view the page.
